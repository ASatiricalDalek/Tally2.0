# Tally2.0
Flask webapp created at CIDL to keep track of information interactions


What is it?

Tally2.0 is a homebrew web application for use at the information desk. It allows librarians to keep track of patron information 
questions online, and allows administrators to run quick reports to figure out how many questions, and in each category, those questions were asked. 
Tally2.0 runs on a Ubuntu 18.04 virtual web server running Apache. It can be accessed at http://tally or 172.16.0.129 
(if the DNS query is not working).
